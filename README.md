# Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision notebooks (just for fun)

For anyone interested in this repository, it is intended to be like a continuation of this repository: "[Computer vision in the new era of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://github.com/albertofernandezvillan/computer-vision-and-deep-learning-course)". That repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks as well as other resources (e.g. presentations, links, ...) that were used during the "Second quarter university extension course" that the University of Oviedo is going to teach (online). For more information about this course, you can check the following [URL](https://www.uniovi.es/estudios/extension/cursos2c/-/asset_publisher/SEp0PJi4ISGo/content/vision-por-computador-en-la-nueva-era-de-la-inteligencia-artificial-y-el-deep-learning?redirect=%2Festudios%2Fextension%2Fcursos2c). Therefore, this repository proposes more examples to explore further some topics.
